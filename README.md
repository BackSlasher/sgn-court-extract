# Israeli court SGN extractor
I got some attachment by mail that is an SGN file from the Israeli court system.  
They require a Windows-only software to view the files.  
This is unthinkable.  

## Caveats
* Doesn't actually verify the digital signature of the file. Be suspicious
* Extracts to current directory

## Fixes
Are welcome! Please PR me
